# Better When Groovy

My fork of Better When Grovy.
Better When Grovy is a mod for Minecraft: BTA! that adds back music from later versions of minecraft, and adds music from the soundtracks not currently used in the game. Make sure to buy C418's music at https://c418.bandcamp.com
This mod also adds music that is highly inspired by C418
Curently this mod adds:
- All C418 Minecraft soundtracks
- Sunrise by Andreas Zoeller
